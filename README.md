# Tongsheng TSDZ2 information collection

The purpose of this repository is to collect technical information of the TSDZ2 (electric bicycle central mid motor with torque sensor). This motor is also known as SFM DU 250.

Most information will be about the motor and display combination I own: 36V/250W with XH18LCD and no throttle connector.
Most will also apply to other versions.
