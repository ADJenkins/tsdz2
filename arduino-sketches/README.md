# Arduino Sketches
Some sketches I had made and used while figuring out how the serial communication works and what the data means.

Please don't expect nice and clean code.

* log-known-messages.ino
  * reads alternating on both serials (RX&TX) and searches for the known messages to log them
* send-custom-message.ino
  * to test how LCD or motor react to custom messages
* speed-pulses.ino
  * simply generates pulses to simulate a particular speed
